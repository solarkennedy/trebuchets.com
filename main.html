  Welcome to the official web site for Trebuchet consultation and information. 
  Here you will find updates on our personal trebuchets, plans to build your own, 
  and advice on any related subject. Please check back frequently for updates, 
  for we are constantly building and dreaming, always for something bigger.</p>

<p>I'm sorry for not being here the past few weeks, I have been out of the loop. Now is the time to start getting this website running full steam.</p>
