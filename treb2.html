<p align="center"><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold">Trebuchet 2 was the first 
  decent trebuchet. It's maximum throwing length was 200 feet, with an orange. 
  We accomplished this using around 250lbs of counter weight. After many revisions, 
  we finally achieved the 200' mark. Trebuchet 2 ended with its disgraceful destruction 
  when we tried to prop the counter weight. The box went on to be used in Trebuchet 
  3. For counterweight, we used mostly water and concrete blocks. We used a piece 
  of 1/2 inch rebar for the axle.</font></p>
