<p align="center"><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold">Trebuchet 1 was just an 
  initial idea. This web page represents all ideas, crappy plans, and make shift 
  models. In actuality, it was our first real trebuchet. It was designed to hurl 
  a small paper towl roll 15 feet. Heh. Then we beefed it up to launch an orange 
  about 30 feet. It was pretty sorry. In fact, it is barely worth mentioning here. 
  It got busted up after a few trials. We launched a banana, and I said I would 
  eat it. I did. </font> </p>
