<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Copperplate Gothic Bold">Many a time we have been 
  asked the question: &quot;Yea, but why?&quot; Well the answer is, in simple 
  terms, &quot;Because its cool!&quot; A more precise answer can be described 
  as follows....</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Copperplate Gothic Bold">Here in our small town 
  of Land O' Lakes, there is not much to do. There is no movie theater, we have 
  a small library, and no night clubs. As 16 year old guys, we must do something 
  to challenge our minds and bodies. It provides for entertainment, watching huge 
  projectiles fly. It also provides a challenge, not only is it physically stressful, 
  but constant problems arise that require us to use our minds to their fullest 
  potential. Building Trebuchets is more than a hobby, it is a passion.</font></p>
